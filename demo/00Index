cworkerPI	R function to use external C program cworkerPI.
		Copy cworkerPI.c in Rmpi library directory to your 
		working directory and compile as "mpicc -o 
		cworkerPI cworkerPI.c"
managerworkerPI 	R script to compute PI=4*\int_0^1 1/(1+x^2) dx.
simPI		Use Monto Carlo simulation to compute PI (with plot). 
                Use simPI to run the program. Run mpi.setup.rngstream
		to setup a parallel RNG.
simplePI 	R function to compute PI using workerdaemon.R. 
worker1PI 	R functions to compute PI using workerdaemon.R (load 
		balancing with a server and workers). Use manager1PI to 
		run the program.
worker2PI 	R functions to compute PI using workerdaemon.R (load 
		balancing with workers only). Use manager2PI to run the 
		program.
